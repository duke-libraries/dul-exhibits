      <p>Sidney D Gamble (1890&ndash;1968) was a sociologist, renowned China scholar and an avid amateur photographer. Gamble's photography of China, shot over four trips between 1908 and 1932, represents an extraordinary contribution to the visual archives for an important period in Chinese history from which few images survive today. These photographs were generously donated to Duke University Libraries in 2006. They were digitized immediately and for the first time, all 5,000 images are available to the public. The exhibition highlights Gamble as a photographer and his intimate relationship with the subjects, presenting the encounter between the West and a changing China as it eagerly embraced modernity.</p>
